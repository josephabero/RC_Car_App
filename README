Motor Control Python Script code to run on the Raspberry Pi for the Autonomous Platform.


Prerequisite Setup:
1. A MQTT server must be running on the Raspberry Pi

- Open a terminal on the Pi and enter
> mosquitto -v

2. A USB camera should be connected to the Pi
3. The RC motors should be connected to the Pi
4. The iOS app should be connected to the MQTT server


Once the prerequisites have been setupk, the integrated app may be run by running the command on the pi:

> python3 integration_test.py




There are 2 Modes:
1. Autonomous Mode
2. Manual Mode


Autonomous Mode
---------------
Autonomous Platform is controlled via the camera aboard the platform.
Control buttons are greyed out and are disabled.
User may switch to Manual Mode by pressing the middle button.


Manual Mode
-----------
Autonomous Platform is controlled by the buttons on the iPhone screen.
Each direction will allow the platform to move in the desired direction.
